# Equity News Querying Tool
Using langchain, the OpenAI API, and streamlit to build a news research tool.
### Chat with a customized online document repository!

On the user interface (web-app), enter 3 links of websites containing the news you need to analyze (limit can be increased if needed).

Enter a query, e.g. a specific question about the contents in these links, or ask for a summary of one or more links.

The tool will pull the data from the web links, process them, and return an answer to your question based on the knowledge base of these links alone.
It will also quote the sources, i.e., which of the 3 links it has derived the answer from.
